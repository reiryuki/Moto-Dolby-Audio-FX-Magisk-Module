# Moto Dolby DAX Audio FX Magisk Module

## Descriptions
An equalizer ported from Motorola Moto G Plus (sofiap_sprout) for any AOSP based Android Pie and up devices

## Guide
- Install the module via Magisk Manager only.

- This module supports Audio Modification Library module and [ACDB module](https://t.me/viperatmos) (choose one), but can be stand alone without it if you are not using multiple audio mods.

- You can install Audio Compatibility Patch module for processing all audio outputs, but in skip notification helper remover, if you choose 'no', then you must use Audio Modification Library module to prevent conflicts. Sometimes, ACP causes cracking sounds.

- Don't use this module with another Dolby or Moto Waves!

- Reboot

- If this module still not working properly, remove/disable your built-in soundfx or deactivate the library and effect through your audio_effects.xml and audio_effects.conf!

## Attention!
- Always make nandroid backup before install or updating version, these are just experiments!

- I only test this on my Redmi 4A rolex AOSP Android 10. Android 11 or other devices may not work.

- Please open issues with logcat if you got problems. Don't report anything without logcat!
